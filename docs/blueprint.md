## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon Blue (#4D4DFF), vibrant and attention-grabbing, used for interactive elements and highlights.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222), nearly black to maintain the Cyberpunk dark mode feel; provides contrast to the neon blue.
- Accent color: Purple (#D44DFF), an analogous color to neon blue; slightly lighter to provide contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), offering a clean, modern look for both headers and body text.
- Use glowing, geometric icons that complement the cyberpunk theme, ensuring they are distinct in both light and dark modes.
- Minimalist layout with rounded buttons, soft shadows, and ample spacing to maintain focus and readability.
- Incorporate smooth scrolling and subtle animated transitions between sections for a seamless user experience.
