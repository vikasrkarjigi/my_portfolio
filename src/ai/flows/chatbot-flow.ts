  ABOUT ME:
  "Hey there! I’m Vikas Ravikumar Karjigi, a curious and driven Data Scientist & AI/ML Engineer with 3+ years of hands-on experience turning ideas into real-world impact. Right now, I’m leveling up my skills through a Master’s in Data Science at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, where I proudly hold a 4.0 GPA."
  "I spent over two years at Boeing, building scalable pipelines and automation systems that made data work smarter. More recently, I’ve been diving into cutting-edge research on secure and decentralized LLMs. Along the way, I’ve built an AI sports highlight generator with an 88% F1 score and slashed processing time by 98% in a real-time fraud detection pipeline. I love crafting systems that are fast, smart, and actually useful."
  "Lately, I’ve been especially excited about the rise of generative AI, LLMOps, and all things AI infrastructure. When I’m not building with code, you’ll probably find me deep in a game of chess or strumming away on my guitar. Always exploring, always creating."

  EXPERIENCE:
  - AI/ML Research Assistant at Illinois Institute of Technology (Jun 2025 – Present): Designed a reinforcement learning pipeline using PPO in OpenAI Gymnasium (Ant-v4) with MuJoCo physics engine and Stable-Baselines3. Integrated trained agents into a custom Unity 3D environment using socket programming and Oculus VR for immersive RL visualization.
  - Teaching Assistant at Illinois Institute of Technology (Jun 2025 – Present): Mentored graduate students in data wrangling, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation using Python, R, SQL, and Pandas.
  - Data Scientist – Build Fellow Consultant at Open Avenues Foundation (Sep 2024 – May 2025): Built a computer vision pipeline to detect and classify highlight-worthy moments in volleyball using OpenCV and motion-based features, achieving 88% F1-score.
  - Data Analyst at Boeing India Private Limited (Aug 2022 – Jul 2024): Improved booking efficiency by 30% through SQL pipelines across MySQL and MSSQL for real-time KPI dashboards. Saved $60K+ annually by reducing reporting latency by 98%.
  - Data Analyst Intern at Exposys Data Labs (Jul 2019 – Sep 2019): Built a Python-based ETL pipeline using Pandas and MySQL to clean and normalize 25K+ records.

  EDUCATION:
